Kedarnath • Tungnath • Badrinath • 5 Prayag • Rishikesh • River Rafting

Step into a journey where every mountain breathes stories, every river carries ancient wisdom, and every moment reconnects you with your own soul.
This is not just a tour — this is a pilgrimage into the heart of the Himalayas.

🌄 Kedarnath — Where Faith Touches the Sky
Walk the sacred path to the divine Jyotirlinga, surrounded by towering peaks and the energy of centuries-old devotion.

🕉 Tungnath — The Highest Shiva Temple in the World
A trek that purifies the mind. A view that transforms the heart.
Here, the Himalayas whisper your purpose.

🌺 Badrinath — The Gateway to Moksha
Seek blessings at the holy shrine of Badri Vishal as the Alaknanda flows beside you like a guide from another lifetime.

🌊 Panch Prayag — The Confluence of Destiny
Witness the meeting of five sacred rivers:
Devprayag, Rudraprayag, Karnaprayag, Nandprayag, Vishnuprayag.
Each confluence is a spiritual milestone, a reminder that all paths eventually unite.

🌱 Rishikesh — Yoga Capital of the World
Experience the calm of Ganga Aarti, the purity of the ghats, and the vibrance of a town where seekers from every corner come to find peace.

⚡ River Rafting — Feel the Power of Ganga
Ride the waves of adventure as the Ganga flows wild and free — a thrilling reminder that life is meant to be lived boldly.

💫 Why We Call This Journey “The Soul of Himalayas”
Because this route isn’t just scenic — it is sacred.
It carries the essence of Shiva, the peace of the sages, the raw beauty of untouched mountains, and the energy that transforms a person from within.

When you return, you don’t just bring back photos — you bring back a new version of yourself.`,
