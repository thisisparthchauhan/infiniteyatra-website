        content: `
            <p>Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) can affect anyone, regardless of fitness level, when traveling above 8,000 feet. Understanding it is key to a safe trek.</p>

            <h3>What is AMS?</h3>
            <p>It occurs when your body doesn't get enough oxygen. Symptoms include headache, nausea, dizziness, and fatigue.</p>

            <h3>Prevention Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acclimatize:</strong> "Climb high, sleep low." Give your body time to adjust.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> Drink 3-4 liters of water daily. Avoid alcohol and smoking.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat Right:</strong> Consume high-carbohydrate meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Diamox (Acetazolamide) can help speed up acclimatization (consult a doctor first).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to do if you get AMS?</h3>
            <p><strong>Descend immediately.</strong> Do not push further. Rest, hydrate, and if symptoms persist, seek medical help. Your life is more important than the summit.</p>

        content: `
            <p>Kedarnath Temple, nestled in the Garhwal Himalayas, is open to devotees only for a few months each year. Choosing the right time to visit is crucial for a safe and spiritually fulfilling journey.</p>

            <h3>Summer (May to June)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Comfortable weather and clear views.</p>
            <p>This is the peak season. The temple opens in late April or early May. The weather is pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C. However, expect large crowds.</p>

            <h3>Monsoon (July to August)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Lush greenery (but risky).</p>
            <p>The region receives heavy rainfall, leading to landslides and road blockages. Helicopter services are often suspended. It's generally advised to avoid this season unless you are an experienced trekker prepared for delays.</p>

            <h3>Autumn (September to October)</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Serenity and photography.</p>
            <p>Post-monsoon, the skies clear up, offering crisp views of the peaks. The crowd thins out compared to summer. It gets colder, especially in late October, so pack warm woolens.</p>

            <h3>Winter (November to April)</h3>
            <p>The temple closes on Bhai Dooj (usually in November) and the deity is moved to Ukhimath. The region remains covered in heavy snow and is inaccessible.</p>
